    <h2>Meet the Developers</h2>

    <p> Nathaniel and Jordan are both junior Information Science & Technology majors at Temple University.
    While participating in the CIS 3344 course, Client-Side Scripting for Web, they were given the
    assignment to develop an app using a framework of their choice. After brainstorming topics,
    they landed on creating an app that helps people find fun Covid-19 safe activities during
    the recent pandemic.</p>

    <h2>Our Goal</h2>
    <p>We are often looking for new places to go and activities. With the effect of 
    being locked down due to Covid, that desire has grown even stronger. However, that 
    thirst can lead to us prolonging life with Covid-19 if people aren’t taking the necessary measures. 
    We propose to develop an application that allows you to search through top-rated nearby restaurants and other social environments. 
    What makes this application a bit different is that most of the content will be user-generated and be more geared to 
    showcasing places that are conscious of the fact that we are dealing with a global pandemic still. 
    We will start by adding our selection of locations that are open and complying with CDC guidelines for operation as a 
    foundation. From there, users would be able to be able to suggest places that should be listed. For further verification, 
    we will implement an rating system that allows them to leave reviews of the location and whether they actually are 
    compliant with social distancing measures. Locations that receive consistent negative reviews or don’t practice proper 
    social distancing measures will be removed the site. It is important for people to be able to have an avenue of social 
    interaction while making sure that it won’t be at the cost of public safety. </p>
